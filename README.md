Implementation of Humanoid Standing Up, from the paper <a href="https://taohuang13.github.io/humanoid-standingup.github.io/">Learning Humanoid Standing-up Control across Diverse Postures</a> out of Shanghai, in Pytorch

Besides for the set of reward functions, the other big contribution is identifying how crucial multiple critics are (with normalized advantages per reward group)
